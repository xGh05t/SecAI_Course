# 2.0 Implementing Threat Modeling and Securing AI Systems

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to support cybersecurity operations introduces new risks, which is why AI threat modeling is so important—it helps you spot potential vulnerabilities before attackers do. By thinking like an adversary and mapping out possible threats, you can better prepare your defenses. It's also vital to implement strong security controls around your AI systems, such as limiting access, regularly updating models, and monitoring for unusual behavior. Taking these steps lets you stay ahead of evolving dangers and ensures your AI solutions remain a reliable part of your security toolkit. In this module, you will analyze and apply threat modeling and resources.
