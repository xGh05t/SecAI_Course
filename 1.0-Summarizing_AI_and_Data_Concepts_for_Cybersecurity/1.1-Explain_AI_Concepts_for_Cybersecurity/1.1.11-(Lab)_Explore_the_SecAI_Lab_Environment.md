## Distinguish Lab Types
In this lab series, you will encounter two types of labs:

- **Local labs:**
Local labs provide a VM environment with the OpenWebUI interface connected to multiple local and cloud-based LLM's for your use throughout the lab series.

- **Cloud labs:**
Cloud Labs will guide you through accessing an Azure tenant to practice building, securing and optimizing an Azure OpenAI LLM.
