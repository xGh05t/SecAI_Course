Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming cybersecurity practices by providing powerful new tools for threat detection, predictive analytics, and automation of security operations. Importantly, it also introduces complex new vulnerabilities stemming from inadequate AI governance, flawed algorithmic implementations, and improper management of sensitive data used to train and operate AI systems. Understanding essential AI concepts, such as Generative AI, Machine Learning (ML), Statistical Learning, Transformers, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP), is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to safely and effectively harness AI's potential while proactively identifying and mitigating associated risks.
