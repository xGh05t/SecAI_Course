## 1. Introduction to AI Types
Different types of AI have evolved over the years.
It all began with machine learning.

## 2. Machine Learning Basics
That's the overall field of AI, where computers learn without
being explicitly programmed.
Patterns are learned from data, which are used to make
predictions or classifications about new, unseen data.
For example, a machine learning model can learn how to
classify emails as spam or not spam.
Machine learning is focused on the accuracy of predictions, whereas
statistical learning is concerned with understanding why a model is
making the prediction that it is.
It's a subfield of statistics and you can see why
models make certain predictions based on the math.
This is the theoretical foundation of many machine learning algorithms.

## 3. Deep Learning
Another type of machine learning is deep learning.
Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain,
it uses layered artificial neural networks to handle really complex
tasks.
Think image recognition, natural language processing and speech recognition.

## 4. Transformers and Their Impact
In 2017, there was a breakthrough in deep learning architecture,
which introduced Transformers.
Transformers transform how AI works with sequences, helping them with
tasks like language translation and writing text.
They're used in a wide range of applications, such as
computer vision and drug discovery.
Transformers made language models much more powerful and paved the
way for generative AI.

## 5. Generative AI
Instead of just recognizing patterns, generative AI generates something new.
From text to images to music to code.
It uses deep learning and is built using transformer architectures.
As AI learns and grows, it gives us new and
improved ways to power the world.
