# Comparing AI Types (Activity)

You are a cybersecurity analyst responding to a suspicious email reported by multiple employees. The message appears to come from helpdesk123@externalmail.com, includes an attachment named Password_Policy_Update.pdf, and contains a link pointing to urgent-update.security-check[.]com.

In this activity, you will interact with two different cybersecurity AI systems:

**REX** – a strict rule-based expert system that only uses explicit policies and documented rules.

**GEN** – a generative language model that uses contextual reasoning, patterns, and best practices.

Ask both AIs the same investigative questions about this email. Consider the different attributes of the message to determine if they match any known threats or violate any company policies. Ask about the sender, the attachment, the URL, and any policy violations. Then ask each AI for its overall recommendation or risk assessment.

When you are finished, use the Summary dialog to explain—in your own words—how the AIs differed, how each one seems to reason, and which was more useful for this scenario.

### REX
```
REX: Greetings, I am REX. How can I help you?

You: You are a cybersecurity analyst responding to a suspicious email reported by multiple employees. The message appears to come from helpdesk123@externalmail.com, includes an attachment named Password_Policy_Update.pdf, and contains a link pointing to urgent-update.security-check.com.

Inform me about the sender, the attachment, the URL, and any policy violations and what the overall recommendation is or risk assessment?

REX: Sender: helpdesk123@externalmail.com is not found in the explicit internal email blacklist. No direct match to known prohibited sender patterns.

Attachment: Password_Policy_Update.pdf is not on the list of blocked file names or explicit blacklisted document hashes.

URL: urgent-update.security-check[.]com is not on the internal URL blacklist. No explicit match to known malicious domains per current policy.

Policy Violations: No direct violations detected; no match found in attachment, sender, or URL blacklists.

Risk Assessment & Recommendation: No explicit rule match for sender, attachment, or URL. Cannot confirm risk or recommend action per internal policy without a documented blacklist or rule match.

### GEN
```
GEN: Hello, I am GEN. How can I help you?

You: You are a cybersecurity analyst responding to a suspicious email reported by multiple employees. The message appears to come from helpdesk123@externalmail.com, includes an attachment named Password_Policy_Update.pdf, and contains a link pointing to urgent-update.security-check.com.

Inform me about the sender, the attachment, the URL, and any policy violations and what the overall recommendation is or risk assessment?

GEN: Certainly! I'll break down each part of the suspicious email and provide reasoning and recommendations for each element:

1. Sender ("helpdesk123@externalmail.com"):
    - The use of “helpdesk123” with an external (not company-owned) email domain is a red flag. Official IT or Helpdesk messages should come from legitimate, internal domains.
    - Attackers often spoof or mimic support addresses to gain user trust.

2. Attachment ("Password_Policy_Update.pdf"):
    - Unsanctioned email attachments about company policy should always be treated with caution, especially when coming from non-official sources.
    - PDF files are a common delivery vector for malware or social engineering payloads.
    - Even if the file is a PDF, malicious code or links can be embedded, or the file could attempt to lure the user into disclosing credentials via a form.

3. URL ("urgent-update.security-check[.]com"):
    - The URL has several suspicious attributes: the use of “urgent-update” and “security-check” tries to impart a sense of urgency and legitimacy, a common tactic in phishing.
    - The domain does not appear to be related to your organization.
    - If this is a newly registered or little-known site, the risk increases.
    - A best practice would be to analyze the domain via a threat intelligence platform, check for known phishing or malware activity, and sandbox any submitted files.

4. Policy Violations:
    - Company security policy likely prohibits responding to or clicking links in unsolicited requests for credentials or policy updates from non-official channels.
    - The message may violate acceptable use by attempting to solicit sensitive information or deploy malware through social engineering.

5. Risk Assessment & Recommendations:
    - This email matches known characteristics of credential phishing and/or malware delivery.
    - The sender, attachment, and link each independently trigger risk indicators.
    - It is highly likely to be malicious, especially due to the external sender, unsolicited attachment, and urgent, policy-related link.

Recommended actions:
    - Instruct employees to not open the attachment or click the link.
    - Submit the attachment and URL to sandbox analysis.
    - Block the sender and listed domain at the email gateway and proxy layers.
    - Issue a company-wide advisory warning about this specific phishing attempt.
    - Continue monitoring for further variants or reports.

### Summary
```
Summary: Based on your conversations with both REX and GEN, compare their answers, describe their reasoning process, identify which was more helpful for this security scenario and why, and summarize your analysis using clear, professional language.

Be specific: refer to concrete differences in responses and justify your judgments with evidence.
```

### Answer
```
REX relied only on explicit rules and blacklists. Since the sender, attachment, and URL were not on any documented blacklist, REX concluded there was no confirmed threat and could not recommend action. Its reasoning was strict and policy-based, but limited to known indicators.

GEN used contextual reasoning and common cybersecurity best practices. It identified red flags such as an external “helpdesk” sender, an unsolicited policy update attachment, and an urgent-looking security-themed URL. GEN assessed the email as highly suspicious and recommended blocking, sandboxing, and warning employees.

GEN was more useful in this scenario because it could recognize phishing patterns even without a blacklist match, while REX could only respond when a specific rule was triggered.
