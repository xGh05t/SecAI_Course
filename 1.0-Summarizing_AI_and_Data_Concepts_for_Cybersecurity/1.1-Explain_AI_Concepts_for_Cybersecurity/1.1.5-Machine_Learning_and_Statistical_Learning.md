# 1.1.5 Machine Learning and Statistical Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that involves teaching computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI approaches that rely on explicitly programmed rules, Machine Learning systems automatically improve their performance via exposure to training data. Popular applications of ML include spam detection, recommendation systems, and image recognition. Statistical learning, which underpins machine learning, focuses on developing mathematical models to explain and predict data behavior, making it useful for tasks like anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

Machine learning and statistical learning play a critical role in automation, improving efficiency, and supporting both offensive and defensive tasks. Approaches that incorporate ML enable security teams to build predictive models to identify emerging threats, automate repetitive tasks like log analysis in new and sophisticated ways, and augment threat-hunting activities by efficiently analyzing large volumes of data.

For example, machine learning can be used to detect suspicious user activity by analyzing behavioral patterns, classify malware,enhance threat intelligence by processing huge volumes of unstructured data, identify covert communication channels, identify credential leak events, and flagmentions of targeted organizations in social media posts, among many other uses.

Additionally, machine learning can be integrated into endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems through APIs, plugins, or custom modules to analyze log data, correlate threat indicators, and automatically flag and prioritize alerts based on threat severity. For instance, models can be trained to recognize patterns of malicious behavior in log data and automatically trigger alerts in the SIEM or EDR interface, enabling security analysts to respond to threats more quickly and effectively. This integration enhances the automation and scalability of threat detection, reducing analyst fatigue and improving response times.

Kaggle hosts competitions, tutorials, and community discussions that make it easier for learners to apply AI concepts to cybersecurity challenges.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised and unsupervised learning represent two core approaches in machine and statistical learning for developing AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with a correct output (such as labeling emails as "spam" or "safe"), enabling high accuracy for tasks like phishing detection. Machine learning models trained using supervised learning may struggle when confronted with novel threats or attacks that were not included during their training phase. This is a significant risk considering that cyber threats are constantly evolving and attackers routinely devise new techniques to bypass existing security controls.

Consequently, a model trained solely on historical data may fail to recognize or react adequately to emerging threats. To address this, unsupervised learning utilizes unlabeled data to identify patterns and anomalies, and excels at discovering previously unknown threats. Supervised learning is best suited for tasks that are well-represented in historical data, whereas unsupervised learning excels at anomaly detection in dynamic, essentially undefined, scenarios. The strengths of supervised learning include precision and auditability whereas unsupervised learning offers scalability and flexibility.

## Practical Example: Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm that excels at identifying anomalies in high-dimensional data (for datasets that have such a wide range of data, it becomes difficult to track them all or identify which data matters the most) by isolating observations that are far from the norm. Its ability to handle large datasets and its resilience to outliers (meaning it can effectively identify anomalies even in high-dimensional data sets) make it a compelling choice for detecting unusual activity in cybersecurity and other data-intensive contexts. In a practical cybersecurity setting, Isolation Forest can be applied to tasks such as detecting unusual patterns in login activity, monitoring file access logs for abnormal behavior, or analyzing network traffic to identify potential intrusion attempts. These applications can help security teams detect insider threats, unauthorized access, or malware activity. However, using Isolation Forest effectively requires thorough data preparation. Real-world data often contains noise, missing values, and inconsistencies that must be addressed before the algorithm can produce meaningful results.

Consequently, data cleanup for Isolation Forest models can become complex and time-consuming, involving detailed preprocessing steps to ensure that features are properly formatted, scaled, and aligned to the model's expectations. This complexity often leads to Python scripts that are significantly more involved than typical data analysis workflows, requiring careful handling to avoid misleading results. Security professionals can integrate tools like Isolation Forest into broader anomaly detection frameworks, while recognizing that its effectiveness is closely tied to data quality, feature engineering, and ongoing model validation. Additionally, Isolation Forest can be integrated with SIEMs (e.g., Splunk, Elastic Security, QRadar) and threat detection platforms.

For example, an SOC analyst could automate anomaly detection by integrating Isolation Forest into a log analysis pipeline that parses logs, extracts details (such as timestamps, IP addresses, and login attempts), formats them for an AI model, and then uses the results to help identify and flag suspicious events. Additionally, developers can integrate Isolation Forest models into cloud-based automation systems such as AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to support tasks like threat hunting, automated triage, and incident response, enabling real-time anomaly detection at scale.
