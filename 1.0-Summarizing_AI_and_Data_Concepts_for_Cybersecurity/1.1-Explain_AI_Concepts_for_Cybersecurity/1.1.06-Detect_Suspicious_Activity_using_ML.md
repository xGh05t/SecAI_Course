## 1. Introduction to Large Language Models
So we've got lots of different large language models that
we can explore.
Some are cloud and some local.
The sophistication level of the different models varies and there's
a lot of things that sort of contribute or facilitate
how powerful that model is.
The complexity of the model, number of parameters and things
that it has is 1.
The other thing is the data that's used to train
it.

## 2. Comparing Local and Cloud Models
General large language models that can kind of answer all
things about all topics that are trained on massive data
sets.
If you were to take a large language models, especially
a private one that you're running locally, I could train
that perhaps with my own data and it could serve
a very specific function.
The data that trains it is really important, but to
demonstrate that we can kind of compare two different models.

## 3. Analyzing Log Data from Devices
I'll use the local model that I have, Mistral, and
what we'll do, I'll give it some log information from
two different devices that are related.
So what we've got is some log data from a
web server and a firewall.
We see various types of attacks.
These are fairly well known.
Without getting into specific details.
In particular, what we see is a malicious file is
uploaded, kind of a classic malicious file right there, and
then an outbound connection is made.
So while these are all distinct and individual things, there
is a relationship here between two of them that would
identify that a breach has successfully occurred.
Now the basic model is going to go through and
it's just going to tell me about what each one
of those things are.
It doesn't have the power and sophistication to be able
to determine or identify that these events are related.
So let's take a look here.

## 4. Identifying Breach Indicators
I think you're going to see it's going to kind
of go through, probably give me full number items telling
me the first thing is directory traversal.
Second thing is equal injection related.
The third thing is a file upload.
And then we see a firewall log that establishes an
outbound connection, but it doesn't correlate those things together.
And this is useful if I didn't know what those
things are.
I've got some insight into what that means now.
That's good.
I appreciate that, but the key piece of knowledge is
the fact that these are related and would be indicative
that this file upload resulted in the attacker being able
to establish a connection to the web server.
Let's compare that.
Perhaps one of our online models will go to GPT
4o.
My hope here is that GPT 4o will be able
to identify that there's a relationship there and will ultimately
tell me this is indicative of a successful breach.
We see a summary of the potential types.

## 5. Comparing Basic and Advanced Models
The overall goal seems to be gaining unauthorized access.
The attacker begins by attempting to gather information.
It's not telling me about those things individually.
It realizes that they come together and there's a story
there, and it's trying to tell me what that story
is.
It's telling me this isn't good and you need to
go and take a look at the system to determine
what's going on here because it's indicative of a breach.
We see the difference there, right?
The power of the model.
A basic model can give me basic information.
A more sophisticated model can give me context around that
information, sort of draw parallels between and understand how things
are related, and then tell me about sort of the
big picture.
Being able to understand the story that the sequence of
those events tell is the key piece, and the sophistication
of the model is going to play a big part
in its ability to be able to help you in
that kind of way.
