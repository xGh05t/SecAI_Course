As a cybersecurity expert, you'll often come across different types of AI—rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, and the latest advancements, such as transformers. Lately, generative AI has been making waves by creating realistic content and even generating code, which brings both new tools and new threats for security professionals. In your work, you'll find that while rule-based AI is useful for spotting known threats, machine learning and deep learning are much better at detecting new, evolving attack patterns. Transformers stand out when it comes to understanding language, making them particularly effective in analyzing phishing emails or malicious messages. By understanding and leveraging these AI techniques, you can stay one step ahead of cybercriminals and better protect your organization.
