# 1.3.6 Activity: Processing Data

Welcome! You will practice reviewing and improving data protection in a new AI-powered help desk platform.

For each step in the system’s workflow, select the most suitable security control from the provided list and briefly explain your choice.

The Data Security Mentor will present each step and issue all scoring and feedback. The ResourceBot is available to provide additional details about logs, data flows, or policies if you need clarification.

Data Handling Solution Reference List
1. **Field Validatio and Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary PII and validate user input at entry.
2. **Data Cleansing (Deduplication/Normalization)**: Eliminate duplicates/inconsistencies before use or analysis.
3. **Cryptographic Hashing and Verification**: Authenticate data before use or transfer by comparing hashes.
4. **Output Filtering/Redaction**: Scrub PII/confidential info from messages before sending externally.
5. **Masking/Anonymization in Logs and Notifications**: Remove or obfuscate sensitive data in stored and sent records.

### Data Security Mentor

```
Data Security Mentor: Welcome! For each help desk phase, choose a control from the list and briefly justify your choice.

When you are ready, type start and press Enter.

You: start

Data Security Mentor: Great, let's begin!

Step 1: Data Collection

The web portal gathers support requests containing users' names, emails, phone numbers, and issue details.

What control would you apply here, and why?

You: Field Validation and Data Minimization. At the data collection stage, risk is highest because this is where sensitive information (PII) first enters the system.

Data Security Mentor: Correct!

Field Validation and Data Minimization is the right choice for data collection. Your justification is appropriate—by validating fields and minimizing the data collected, you help ensure the system receives only necessary information in the expected format, which reduces exposure to unnecessary sensitive data.

Step 2: Data Cleansing and Preparation
Now, imported files contain duplicate tickets and mismatched user information.

Which control would you apply here, and why?

You: Data Cleansing (Deduplication/Normalization). At this stage, the issue isn’t about collection or exposure; it’s about data quality and integrity.

Data Security Mentor: Correct!

Data Cleansing (Deduplication/Normalization) is the best option here. Your explanation fits: ensuring the accuracy and consistency of records during import prevents inconsistencies that can lead to downstream errors or security issues.

Step 3: Data Verification & Integrity
Suppose you’re concerned about tampering during transfers between systems.

What control would you apply at this stage, and why?

You: Cryptographic Hashing and Verification. At this stage, the concern is tampering during data transfer between systems, which is an integrity issue.

Data Security Mentor: Correct!

Cryptographic Hashing and Verification fits perfectly here. By hashing data before transfer and verifying it upon receipt, you ensure data hasn’t been altered or tampered with during transit—addressing integrity risks.

Step 4: Model Output Filtering
The AI sometimes replies: “Hi Jane Smith, your password reset ticket is with Miami support.”

What control would you apply here, and why?

You: Output Filtering/Redaction. At this stage, the risk is that sensitive information may be exposed in AI-generated responses.

Data Security Mentor: Correct!

Output Filtering/Redaction is the right control for this point in the workflow. Your explanation is spot-on: filtering or redacting prevents the unintentional exposure of sensitive information in responses generated by the AI.

Step 5: Notifications and Log Storage
You notice PII (names, emails) present in archived logs and old notifications.

What control would you apply here, and why?

You: Masking/Anonymization in Logs and Notifications. At this stage, the issue isn’t real-time output; it’s stored records and archived communications containing unnecessary PII.

Data Security Mentor: Correct!

Masking/Anonymization in Logs and Notifications is the best control here. Your justification is accurate: minimizing or anonymizing stored PII reduces potential impact if archival data is accessed inappropriately, and it supports compliance with data retention and privacy requirements.

That’s the final step! If you’re ready, select Score to end the interactive. If you’d like feedback or have questions on any step, let me know!
