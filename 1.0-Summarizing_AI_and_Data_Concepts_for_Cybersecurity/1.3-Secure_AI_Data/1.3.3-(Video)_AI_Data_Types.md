## 1. Introduction to AI and Data
AI runs on data, and the world has tons of
it.
But not all data is the same.

## 2. Structured Data
The way data is organized actually influences how AI can
use it.
Think of data organization like a library.
Books in a library are carefully shelved based on genre,
category, and author.
This makes them easily located and loggable.
In a computer database, this is like structured data.
It's highly organized and a blueprint or a schema rigidly
defines the data's format.
This formatting makes it easily searchable and interpreted by machines.

## 3. Semi-Structured Data
Imagine the library is having a book sale and the
books are arranged roughly into general categories with signs giving
additional information.
This is like semi structured data.
It doesn't conform to strict formatting conventions like structured data,
but it does contain tags and other markers.

## 4. Unstructured Data
Think JSON and XML.
This organization is more flexible because there could be many
data fields about a subject, or maybe only a few.
Now imagine the backroom of the library where book returns
haven't been sorted at all.
This is like unstructured data, a massive collection of information
with no organization.

## 5. Conclusion
Most data in the world is like this and it's
much more difficult to process and analyze it compared to
structured and semi structured data.
Special tools are needed to extract meaning like deep learning
models.
The more organized your data is, the less effort needed
for AI to work with it and the less organized
it is.
More powerful and resource intensive AI techniques are needed to
make the data use
