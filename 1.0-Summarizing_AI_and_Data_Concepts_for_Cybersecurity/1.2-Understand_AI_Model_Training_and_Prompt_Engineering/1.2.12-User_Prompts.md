While the system role sets the outer guardrails, the ***user prompt*** is the steering wheel that directs the model toward a specific analytic goal. Designing an effective prompt means blending three elements in a single, concise instruction: context (the evidence the model will inspect), perspective (the analytical lens or persona it should adopt), and output shape (the exact format required by downstream tools).

Consider a practical scenario in which an analyst pastes a decoded PowerShell script that downloads an executable from an unfamiliar IP address. The prompt might read: "You are a malware analyst. Determine which phase of the attack chain this command represents, rate its risk on a scale of 1–10, and suggest two containment actions. Return the results as JSON with the keys 'risk_score and attack_phase'" (JSON keys refer to the field names that identify each piece of data in a structured format, ensuring the output can be easily understood by both humans and security tools.) This single sentence tells the model what to examine, how to think about it, and how to present the findings, producing an answer that can be ingested directly by a ticketing or SIEM system.

The same structure can be applied to a simpler artifact (such as a firewall log entry or a suspicious URL), changing only the perspective and desired JSON keys. Because the prompt specifies the schema, the model will still return a neatly structured response that is easy to parse and act upon.

It is critical, however, to handle sensitive telemetry responsibly. Prompts often include client IP addresses, internal hostnames, or proprietary code. Before sending such data to a public model, teams should replace identifying details with realistic placeholders (substituting 192.168.10.25 with 192.168.x.x, for instance, or renaming a private S3 bucket to bucket_placeholder. Tokenized replacements) where sensitive values are swapped with consistent, format‑preserving tokens that mimic the structure of genuine logs to preserve the structural relationships the model needs to reason accurately while ensuring no confidential information is exposed.
