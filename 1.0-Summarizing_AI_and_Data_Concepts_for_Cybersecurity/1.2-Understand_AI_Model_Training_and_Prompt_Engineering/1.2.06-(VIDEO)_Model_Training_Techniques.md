## 1. Introduction to AI Learning Methods
In school, you were taught information and tested on it
using different methods like lectures and quizzes.
Similarly, when it comes to AI, there are different methods
for teaching AI models and testing what they've learned.

## 2. Supervised Learning
For example, imagine taking a test and checking your own
answers with the answer key.
That's like supervised learning.
A computer learns by making predictions and comparing them against
a labeled data set, the answer key to test its
own accuracy.
The computer can then make adjustments to improve its predictions.

## 3. Unsupervised Learning
Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning has no answer key.
Because we're asking the computer to figure out what we're
looking for.
We give it a big pile of data and challenge
the algorithm to find patterns on its own.
This is helpful for discovering hidden patterns in data.

## 4. Applications of Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is often used in market research.
For example, here's a bunch of customer data.
What patterns exist in their buying behavior?
We don't know yet, but the algorithm will identify them.
If you've ever taught a dog a new trick, you've
experienced learning by trial and error.

## 5. Reinforcement Learning
This is like reinforcement learning for AI.
The model or agent interacts with an environment and receives
rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.
The goal is to learn the best strategy or policy
to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
When AI learns to play a game or autonomous navigation,
reinforcement learning is the primary method.
Have you ever memorized all the answers to a test
and aced it, but later realized you never really learned
the information and probably couldn't apply it again?
AI has a similar problem.
Sometimes it might memorize the training data instead of truly
learning.

## 6. Overfitting and Model Validation
This problem is called over fitting.
So it's important to test the model on new real
world data it's never seen before to ensure training was
successful in a process called model validation.
Here's one common validation method.
Split the initial data set into a training set and
a testing set.
The model trains on one, then tests on the other.
OK, let's say you majored in computer science in your
undergrad, then got a master's degree in data science.
You learned broadly and then specialized.
This is like fine tuning AI.

## 7. Fine-Tuning AI Models
That's the process of taking an existing model which has
already trained on lots of data and further training it
on a specific data set so it's suited to performing
a specific task.
For example, let's say a company has an existing large
language model.
If they train it on their internal company documents, they
can use it to create a specialized support chat bot
that understands the company.

## 8. Conclusion
These techniques help AI grow smarter and adapt to real
world applications.
