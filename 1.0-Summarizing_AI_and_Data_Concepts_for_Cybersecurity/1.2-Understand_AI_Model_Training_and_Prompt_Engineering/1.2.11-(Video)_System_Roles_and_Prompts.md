# 1.2.11 System Roles and Prompts (Video Transcript)

## 1. Introduction to System Roles
One of the other things that we can do when
we use our large language models to help kind of
shape the outputs we get from our prompts is to
provide it with a system role.

## 2. Using System Roles in Prompts
You can include it in the prompt and it's a
very simple thing.
You can say, for example, you are a risk manager.
Provide a description of this event in a way that
is relevant to an executive leader.

## 3. Changing the Prompt Context
And then I can put in there maybe a log
example, kind of a technical log example.
Not entirely sure what it's going to provide me an
output here, but we'll put it in there anyway and
let's see what it gives us.
And it gives me that in really general term.
Now, I could also change that prompt.
The language is descriptive and high level.

## 4. Creating Global System Prompts
Instead of being a risk manager, I could say you
are a SOC analyst.
Provide a technical description of this event and it's going
to give me a completely different type of description and
it's going to get into the weeds and the details
of what that really means.
The system prompt kind of tells pretend that you are
kind of thing, and then the outputs are going to
be based on that context.
Now to take that a step further, instead of me
having to think through how to create this sort of
lead into the thing that I want, I can create
sort of a global setting, a system prompt.

## 5. Example of System Prompt in Action
Open Web UI allows me to create system prompts.
I'm going to go to settings under general notice I
got this area called System Prompt.

## 6. Removing the System Prompt
So I'm going to put in there some stuff that
will shape all of the outputs from this point on.
So I've got one here that I created before.
I'll just paste it right into the system prompt.
Act as a junior security operation center analyst.
Your task is to analyze a log entry for a
senior analyst for the following access log, this one, this
for Apache, let's say this for the log entry, provide
the attack identification, objective analysis, recommended actions presented in the
clear bulleted list.
I'm just putting that as a system prompt.
Now that I've done that, I'm just going to put
in there that log entry, copy and paste the first
one that I did, and then let's see what we
get.

## 7. Benefits of System Prompts
See the system prompt come to life here.
We say provide the bulleted list, attack identification, objective analysis,
recommended actions.
He gave me exactly that, right?
Let's grab another one.
Let's grab one from an Apache web server here, and
we're going to see that output again.
It's going to be the exact same thing, like attack
identification, objective analysis, recommended actions.
Why is it doing this?
Because I created a system prompt.
So long as that system prompt exists, it's going to
provide me the output in exactly that way, shaping the
whole thing.
I didn't even put anything in there about what I
wanted.
I just dumped the log entry in there and it's
providing me with this objective analysis.
Let's do one more.
I got a firewall one here, copy and paste, and
it should do the same thing.
It's thinking a little bit harder on this one, but
because the system prompt is in still in place, we
should still see the attack identification objective analysis.
We got that same output.
Kind of cool, right?
It saves me a lot of typing and thinking.
I do the thinking once and I just save it
as the system prompt just to make a point.
If I come up here now and remove the system
prompt, say save, and then I can come in here
again and say, you know, summarize this log event and
then just paste it in there, we should see that
formatting goes away, see it's gone.
So the system prompt can be really, really useful, especially
if I was setting this up in a way where
my team was going to use it in a really
specific roles, like a SOC analyst, for example, right?
I can create an interface that they would use, and
I can create the system prompt that sort of the
overarching specifications of how the output is presented.
And the SOC analyst can just Simply put any information
that they want and get exactly what it is they
need.
And they don't need a lot of general stuff, broad
descriptions, they just need the bulleted lists.
