When working with AI models in cybersecurity, it's important to know how they learn. Some use supervised learning (where they're trained on labeled data) while others use reinforcement learning, learning by trial and error. A big part of working with these models is prompt engineering, which involves crafting system and user prompts to get the best results; system prompts set the AI's role, and user prompts ask specific questions or give instructions. You might use "zero-shot" prompts (where the AI gets no examples), "one-shot" (one example), or "multi-shot" (several examples), depending on how much guidance you want to give. In addition, it's crucial to secure the model and its data so that sensitive information isn't exposed and bad actors can not manipulate the underlying system.
