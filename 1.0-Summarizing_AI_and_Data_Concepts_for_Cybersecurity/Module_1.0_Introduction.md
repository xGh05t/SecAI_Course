# 1.0 Summarizing AI and Data Concepts for Cybersecurity

Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming a powerful tool in cybersecurity, helping us automate threat detection, speed up our response to attacks, and even predict security issues before they happen. Some important AI concepts you should know about include machine learning, natural language processing, and anomaly detection—these all help systems identify and react to cyber threats. When it comes to using AI, it's also important to understand how models are trained and how prompt engineering works; training involves teaching an AI with lots of data, while prompt engineering is about asking the right questions to get the best answers from the AI. And, just as with any technology, keeping AI data secure is critical—protecting that data ensures our models work as they should and helps prevent new risks from being introduced. In this module, we'll examine AI concepts, model training, prompt engineering, and secure AI data.
